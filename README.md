CSC 434 PROJECT - Group 4 
A blood bank center of an organization needs an efficient way to manage information about the blood collected from donors and given to their patients who are in need of it. It should be noted that blood is only accepted from the donor if the donor’s blood is medically approved for donation and is only made available to the receiver or patient if there is a match between them.
Design and develop a Web application using your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP that allows the collection center to store information about the exchange of blood between donors and receivers. Your application should have a dashboard for the center that allows to view all donors who have supplied blood to them and all those who have been their recipients. The application should be able to keep track of the reasons for the blood transfer and make an analysis out of this. The patient should be able to see the contact of the donor he/she received their blood and appreciate them depending on his/her wish. Anyone can donate to the center but only registered patients can make request for blood.
