CSC 434 PROJECT - Group 4 
A blood bank center of an organization needs an efficient way to manage information about the blood collected from donors and given to their patients who are in need of it. It should be noted that blood is only accepted from the donor if the donor’s blood is medically approved for donation and is only made available to the receiver or patient if there is a match between them.
Design and develop a Web application using your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP that allows the collection center to store information about the exchange of blood between donors and receivers. Your application should have a dashboard for the center that allows to view all donors who have supplied blood to them and all those who have been their recipients. The application should be able to keep track of the reasons for the blood transfer and make an analysis out of this. The patient should be able to see the contact of the donor he/she received their blood and appreciate them depending on his/her wish. Anyone can donate to the center but only registered patients can make request for blood.


Breakdown
Users:
1.	Blood bank center employees(admin)
2.	Blood donors
3.	Blood recipents

Who has a need to:
1.	Manage information about the blood collected from donors and given to their patients who are in need of it. (blood is only accepted from the donor if the donor’s blood is medically approved for donation and is only made available to the receiver or patient if there is a match between them)
2.	Apply to donate blood
3.	Know their donors are and have an option for them to reach out to appreciate their donors

Our applications gives them this as value:
1.	A dashboard that allows to view: All donors and their blood status (Donated, testing, rejected, approved), possible matches between donor and recipient; grant donations, see reasons for transfer, analysis of and outcomes/result of transfer.
2.	Have the option to donate blood(form) and receive appreciation gifts and messages from their blood recipients.
3.	Have the option to register (paid/free)(form), request for blood, know if they get a match(alerts), know who their blood donor is, and appreciate them.(Basically they'll have a dashboard as well)

Thing to note:
1. Both donors and recipients should be offered the option to create account
2. But only those with accounts can request, but shoeld also be able to donate at any time as well
3. We should be able to perform some analysis on the blood maybe make it app do the matching( If you have type O blood, you’re called a universal donor. If you have type AB blood, you can receive any type of blood and you’re called a universal recipient), and make an analysis on the reasons for the bood transfer( Some examples of reasons
- Major surgery or a serious injury and you need to replace lost blood
- You’ve experienced bleeding in your digestive tract from an ulcer or other condition
- You have an illness like leukemia or kidney disease that causes anemia (not enough healthy red blood cells)
- You’ve received cancer treatments like radiation or chemotherapy
- You have a blood disorder or severe liver problems) the analysis can be Maybe ranking in order of importance so the centre know who needs blood most urgently


Okayyyyy, so guys we can start with this breakdown
